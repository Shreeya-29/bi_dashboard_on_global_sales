Project Objective:
The objective of this project is to help businesses analyze their sales data in a simple and effective way. The dashboard provides clear insights into sales trends, profits, and customer behavior. It also includes time series analysis to predict future sales, allowing businesses to plan better and make informed decisions.

Project Background:
This Power BI dashboard was created to make sales data easy to understand. Instead of looking at raw numbers, the dashboard uses charts and graphs to show important patterns and trends.

Dashboard Overview:
The dashboard is structured into two pages, each serving a distinct analytical purpose.

Page 1: Sales Performance Dashboard
This page provides a comprehensive view of sales performance through KPIs, including Total Sales, Quantity Sold, Average Delivery Days, and Profits. Various visualizations are used to present the data effectively:
  - Bar Charts: Display insights on Top Products by Profits, Sales by Category, and Sales by Sub-Category.
  - Donut Charts: Show Sales by Segment (Corporate, Home Office, Consumer) and Sales by Order Priority (Low, Medium, High, Critical).
  - Stacked Area Charts: Track Profit & Sales Trends by Month and Year, helping identify seasonal patterns.
  - Map Visualization: Represents Sales by Region, with bubble sizes indicating sales volume.
  - Year Selector: Allows filtering data for 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015, enabling comparative analysis over time.

Page 2: Sales Forecasting
This page focuses on predicting future sales trends using time series analysis. It includes:
  - Sales Forecasts by Year and Month, helping businesses anticipate future performance.
  - Regional Sales Projections using clustered bar charts, providing insights into expected sales distribution across different locations.
